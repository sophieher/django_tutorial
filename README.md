Django project includes app tutorial polls, and food diary app FoodMood

FoodMood currently in development

FoodMood is a food diary app for you to chronicle your mood after eating.

You choose the meal you're eating, write in your food, and pick your mood.
The mood is chosen via a slider and has emoji representations of your mood.

This app will have a trends page to show you how you've felt over the past week/month/year after the foods you've eaten.
